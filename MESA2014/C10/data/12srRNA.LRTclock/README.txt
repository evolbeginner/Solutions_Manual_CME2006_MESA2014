
These files are for testing the molecular clock using the likelihood ratio test.
Run baseml twice, once with clock = 1 (for the null model) and using a rooted tree, 
and another time with clock = 0 using an unrooted tree (the alternative model).  
Count the parameters correctly when doing the likelihood ratio test.
