**Solution.**

We run the analysis for only the independent rate (IR; clock2) and
correlated rate (AR; clock3) model. For global rate, obviously nothing
would change. I change the gamma priors for rate as "rgene_gamma = 1 10"
and set the gamma priors for sigma2 as "sigma2_gamma = 10 1" in the file
*mcmctree.ctl*. After MCMCTree run is finished, I use the following
script to summarize the result.

```Bash
Bash scripts/get_bl_CI_interval.sh FigTree.tre --minmax --format mcmctree --header > time-ci.tbl
Rscript scripts/compare_age.R -i ori/time-ci.tbl -j change_rgene_sigma/time-ci.tbl -m 0,2 -c blue -o ci-compare.pdf
```

The results are displayed in the following graph for IR (left) and AR
(right), where the mean and 95% HPD interval are indicated between using
the original priors and the changed priors.
