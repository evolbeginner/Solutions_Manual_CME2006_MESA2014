**Solution.**

Recall Eq. (4.26) in (Yang 2014a), where the transition matrix is given
as

$$P(0.2) = \begin{bmatrix}
0.811138 & 0.080114 & 0.082824 & 0.025924 \\
0.055240 & 0.836012 & 0.082824 & 0.025924 \\
0.055240 & 0.080114 & 0.838722 & 0.025924 \\
0.055240 & 0.080114 & 0.082824 & 0.781821
\end{bmatrix}.$$

Denote the ancestral node as node 0, such that its ancestral state is
expressed as $X_{0}$ which can take any of the four nucleotides, denoted
as $x_{0}$. The posterior probability that the ancestral node (node 0)
takes character $x_{0}$ can be expressed as follows, according to Eq.
(4.23) of (Yang 2014a)

$$f\left( x_{0} \middle| x_{h};\theta \right) = \frac{\pi_{x_{0}}L_{0}\left( x_{0} \right)}{\sum_{x_{0} \in \left\{ T,C,A,G \right\}}^{}{\pi_{x_{0}}L_{0}\left( x_{0} \right)}}.$$

According to the problem statement, the equilibrium frequencies of each
nucleotide are given as
$\pi_{T} = 0.2263,\ \pi_{C} = 0.3282,\ \pi_{A} = 0.3393,\ \pi_{G} = 0.1062.$

For the first site $x_{1} = A$, it can be calculated that

$${\pi_{A}L_{0}(T) = 0.2263 \times 0.055240 = 0.01250081,
}{\pi_{C}L_{0}(C) = 0.3282 \times 0.080114 = 0.02629341,
}{\pi_{A}L_{0}(A) = 0.3393 \times 0.838722 = 0.2845784,
}{\pi_{G}L_{0}(G) = 0.1062 \times 0.025924 = 0.002753129.}$$

Accordingly, we obtain

$$\sum_{x_{0} \in \left\{ T,C,A,G \right\}}^{}{\pi_{x_{0}}L_{0}\left( x_{0} \right)} = 0.01250081 + 0.02629341 + 0.2845784 + 0.002753129 = 0.3261257.$$

Hence, it is easy to calculate that the posterior probabilities at the
ancestral node at the first site are
$0.038331257,\ 0.080623533,\ 0.872603285,\ 0.008441925$ for $T,C,A,G$,
respectively.

The result is the same for the second site which is also A.

The third site is G. We have

$$\pi_{A}L_{0}(G) = 0.2263 \times 0.055240 = 0.01250081,$$

$$\pi_{C}L_{0}(C) = 0.3282 \times 0.080114 = 0.02629341,$$

$$\pi_{A}L_{0}(A) = 0.3393 \times 0.082824 = 0.02810218,$$

$$\pi_{G}L_{0}(G) = 0.1062 \times 0.781821 = 0.08302939.$$

Hence, it is easy to calculate that the posterior probabilities at the
ancestral node at the first site are 0.08337998, 0.17537616, 0.18744060,
0.55380325 for $T,C,A,G$, respectively.
