**Solution 1.**

Briefly, for a Bayesian analysis, you have to specify a prior, no matter if you like it or not.

**Solution 2 (by [Korbinian Strimmer](https://strimmerlab.github.io/korbinian.html)).**

In my understanding, the answer to the open question is as follows.  

The key thing to understand is there is always prior information involved in any estimation procedure, either you specify it explicitly or it is implicit in the procedure. The second insight is that there are no neutral or uniformative priors.   Hence it is best to acknowledge that a prior is used, and then choose the one that has known properties and is minimally informative, rather than using the implicit prior that may have unknown properties that will potentially strongly bias your estimation. For example, maximum likelihood is equivalent to  assuming a flat prior and finding the maximum a-posteriori estimate.   However, this implicit prior is typically improper and is not protecting the model from overfitting, hence leading to poor estimates when sample size is small. The only case when you can ignore the prior is when the sample size is very large compared to the number of parameters in the model, because then the prior will have neglible influence on the estimate.
