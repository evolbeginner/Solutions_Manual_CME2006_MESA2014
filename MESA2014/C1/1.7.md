**Solution.**

If you were as lazy as I, you can find the data necessary to do the
likelihood ratio test in Table 1.4 of (Yang 2014a) where the
log-likelihoods under K80 and GTR are $- 1637.90\ $and $- 1610.36$
respectively. Thus, the difference of log-likelihood is equal to
$1637.90 - 1610.36 = 27.54$. The number of different parameters of these
two nested models are $8 - 1 = 7$. The following R code gives the
*P*-value of the LRT test, which is 1.43747e-09, therefore the simpler
model K80 is rejected at a significance level of 0.05. Note that it is
$27.54 \times 2 = 55.08$ that should be the statistic to use.

```R
pchisq(27.54\*2, 7, lower.tail=FALSE)
```
