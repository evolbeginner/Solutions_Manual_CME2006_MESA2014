**Solution.**

This is an open question. Based on my limited experience, people would like to make a balance between leveraging prior knowledge and maintaining the integrity of the empirical evidence. Using a properly chosen prior could lead to more reasonable estimates, particularly when there is only limited data. But on the other side, we also hope to perform sensitivity analyses to ensure that the results are not too heavily affected by our prior beliefs and the extent to which the results are affected by different priors. By evaluating the posteriors under different priors, we can have a better idea of how robust the posterior is robust to the prior.
