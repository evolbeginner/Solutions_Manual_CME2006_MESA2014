**Solution.**

If you were as lazy as me, you could simply use the following R code for the purpose. Note that the R packages ape (Paradis and Schliep 2019) and Phangorn (Schliep 2011) need to be installed.

```R
#! /usr/bin/env Rscript
library(ape)
library(phangorn)
coalescent_tree <- rcoal(10)
simSeq(coalescent_tree, type="DNA", l=1000) # need to further check if the default model is JC69
```
