**Solution.**

I use BP&P v3.4a (Yang 2015) for this analysis. Note that for species delimitation, 
users should set speciesdelimitation=1 and speciestree=0 in the control file, thus 
the mode “A10”. The results of using one to four loci are displayed as follows where 
the posterior probabilities of the two models are given. Note that Model 0 denotes the 
hypothesis that all belong to the same species while Model 1 denotes the hypothesis that 
the species delimitation should be as indicated in the “Imap” file with species D and E.
