**Solution.**

I use EVOLER to simulate 1000 replicates of sequences under JC69 with
sequence distances from 0.1 to 1.0 (every 0.2) and sequence lengths
$l$ = 50, 100, 200, and 500. Then run BASEML with both
JC69 and K80. Summarize the results using the R script *12.5.R*. You can
use the following Bash command to get the following histogram. It looks
that with a larger $d$ and longer sequence, the distribution of
$2\Delta$ better approximates $\chi_{1}$. The codes are available at
*12.5.sh* and *12.5.R*.
