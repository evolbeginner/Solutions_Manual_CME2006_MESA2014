**Solution.**

You are welcome to follow what is told in the problem but I am lazy
enough to just take the nucleotide alignment from Problem 4.5, i.e., the
file "rbcL.nogaps_amb.fas". Here, I choose to use IQ-Tree and raxml-ng
for tree construction. The command is as follows (**4.6.sh**). Note that JC69 is
specified as "JC", and HKY85 is specified as "HKY" in raxml-ng.

```Bash
#! /bin/bash
# IQ-Tree
mkdir iqtree
cd iqtree
for m in JC69 K80 HKY85 GTR JC69+G5 K80+G5 HKY85+G5 GTR+G5; do
	echo $m
	iqtree -redo -m $m -pre $m -s ../sample.fasta -quiet
done
cd ..
# raxml-ng
mkdir raxml-ng
cd raxml-ng
for m in JC K80 HKY GTR JC+G5 K80+G5 HKY+G5 GTR+G5; do
	echo $m
	raxml-ng --redo --msa ../sample.fasta --model $m --prefix $m
done
cd ..
```

Then, use the following Bash command to summarize the result shown at
the end.

```Bash
for m in JC69 K80 HKY85 GTR JC69+G5 K80+G5 HKY85+G5 GTR+G5; do grep "BEST SCORE FOUND" iqtree/$m.log | awk '{print $NF}'; done
for m in JC K80 HKY GTR JC+G5 K80+G5 HKY+G5 GTR+G5; do grep "Final LogLikelihood" raxml-ng/$m.raxml.log | awk '{print $NF}'; done
```
