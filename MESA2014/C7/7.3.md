**Solution.**

It is straightforward to use the following R code to get
$\alpha_{left} = \frac{\pi(9.9)}{\pi(10)} = 1.000574$, and
$\alpha_{right} = \frac{\pi(10.1)}{\pi(10)} = 0.9994979$.

```R
lnl_JC69 <- function(d, n, x) x*log(3/4-3/4*exp(-4/3*d)) + (n-x)*log(1/4+3/4*exp(-4/3*d))
n <- 948; x <- 90;
exp(lnl_JC69(9.9,n=n,x=x) - lnl_JC69(10,n=n,x=x))
exp(lnl_JC69(10.1,n=n,x=x) - lnl_JC69(10,n=n,x=x))
```

Using a starting value of $\theta_{start} = 10$ and sliding window width
$w = 0.2$ would lead to the correct estimate. However,
$\theta_{start} = 100$ will lead to poor mixing given $w = 0.2$, as
there is little difference between $\pi(99.8)$,$\ \pi(100)$ and
$\pi(100.2)$. Changing $w$ to a bigger value can overcome this problem.
