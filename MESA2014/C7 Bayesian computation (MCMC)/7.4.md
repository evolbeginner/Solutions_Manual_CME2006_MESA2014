Refer to Eq. (7.30) in (Yang 2014a):

$$\pi(x,y) \propto e^{- \left( x^{2} + x^{2}y^{2} + y^{2} \right)},\  - \infty < x,y < \infty.$$

The acceptance ratios of using a 2-D and 1-D sliding windows should be
close to 0% and 25% respectively, if the step size is set to 10 for
both. Also, the posterior means of using the 2-D sliding window would be
far away from the MLEs x=0, y=0.
