**Solution.**

Denote the probability that the gene tree has the topology
$\left( \left( a_{1},a_{2} \right),b \right)$ as $P_{same}$ and the
probability of other gene tree topologies as $P_{diff}$. According to
the problem statement, we have

$$P_{diff} = P_{no\_ coal} \times P_{joining},$$

where $P_{no\_ coal}$ is the probability that sequences $a_{1}$ and
$a_{2}$ do not coalesce in population $A$, and $P_{joining}$ indicates
the probability that random joining of all gene sequences in population
$AB$. It is not difficult to see the following

$${P_{no\_ coal} = e^{- \frac{\tau}{2N}},
}{P_{joining} = \frac{2}{3}.}$$

So

$$P_{same} = 1 - P_{diff} = 1 - \frac{2}{3}e^{- \frac{\tau}{2N}}.$$
