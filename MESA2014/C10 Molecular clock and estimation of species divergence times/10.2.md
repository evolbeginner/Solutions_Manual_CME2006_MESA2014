**Solution.**

See the data set Steiper2004 from C10 in (Yang 2014b). We take the
global clock as an example. Open *mcmctree.clock2.ctl*, the control file
for MCMCTree.

1.  HKY+G5: use HKY with five rate categories of discrete gamma
    distribution. In Line 5, change to the alignment file separated as
    five loci *Steiper2004ABCDE.txt*. In Line 8, set *ndata* = 5. Run
    MCMCTree.

2.  JC69. On top of *mcmctree.clock2.ctl*, edit Line 13 to change model
    = 0 and Line 14 to set alpha = 0. Run MCMCTree.

The results, as compared to those shown in Table 10.1 in (Yang 2014a),
are summarized as follows (STR: strict rate or global rate; IR:
independent rate; AR: autocorrelated rate). The posteriors estimated
by treating the five genes as independent loci should yield narrower
CI intervals under independent or correlated rate models (but not the
global clock because for global clock applying independent loci does
not change any parameter).
