**Solution.**

Note that

$${P(Class = 0) = p_{0} = 0.5,}$$

$${P(Class = 1) = p_{1} = 0.3,}$$

$${P(Class = 2a) = \frac{\left( 1\  - \ p_{0}\  - \ p_{1} \right)p_{0}}{p_{0}\  + \ p_{1}} = 0.125,}$$

$${P(Class = 2b) = \frac{\left( 1\  - \ p_{0}\  - \ p_{1} \right)p_{1}}{p_{0}\  + \ p_{1}} = 0.075.}$$

To simulate codon sequences under the branch-site model, we need to use
the program evolverNSbranchsites from PAML, which however is not
compiled in the default mode of installation. One has to type the
following in Bash to compile evolver to do codon sequence simulation
under the branch-site model (as well as the branch and site models if
necessary). The control files used to simulate sequences under the null
hypothesis are provided in the folder "C11/data/11.4/".

```
cd ./paml/src/
cc -O2 -DCodonNSbranches -o evolverNSbranches evolver.c tools.c -lm
cc -O2 -DCodonNSsites -o evolverNSsites evolver.c tools.c -lms                                                                      |
cl -O2 -DCodonNSbranchsites -o evolverNSbranchsites evolver.c tools.c
-lm
```

After simulation of sequence evolution, to set the control file
codeml.ctl for the unconstrained analysis, one needs to make sure
$model = 2,Nsites = 2,fix\_ omega = 0.$ To set it for the constrained
analysis (under the null hypothesis), one needs to change the above
settings to $model = 2,Nsites = 2,fix\_ omega = 1,omega = 1.$ The
control files as well as the results are provided in the folder
"C11/data/11.4/".

The result is summarized as follows. Note that datasets where
$2\Delta L < 0$ are discarded.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Sequence length**     **Proportion of datasets where**            **Proportion of datasets where**
                          $\mathbf{2}\mathbf{\Delta}\mathbf{L = 0}$   $\mathbf{2}\mathbf{\Delta}\mathbf{L > 2.71}$
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  50                      0.4941995                                   0.08352668

  100                     0.556044                                    0.06483516

  200                     0.6013143                                   0.05257393

  500                     0.6015284                                   0.06004367

As follows the histograms of the $2\Delta\mathcal{l}$, the likelihood
ratio test statistic, for the branch-site test are plotted against the
curve of $\chi_{1}^{2}$ density. Note that datasets with $2\Delta L = 0$
are not included in the plot and that sequence length indicates the
number of **codons** instead of that of nucleotides.

The result is generally supportive of the conclusions of (Yang and Dos
Reis 2011), but note the differences in the proportions of datasets
where $2\Delta L = 0$ and where $2\Delta L = 0$ which suggests the
impact of tree topologies and branches to test.
