**Solution.**

According to the problem statement, label the following branch as "#1"
in the tree, which is the so-called foreground lineage in the analysis.

Then, run codeml under the branch model (model=2, NSsites=0) and
branch-site (model=2, NSsites=2) model. The positively selected sites
identified by the NEB and BEB methods are given as follows \[but note
that BEB is more reliable and is suggested to use; see (Yang 2014a)\].
More detailed results are given in *data/11.2/B-mlc* and
*data/11.2/BS-mlc*.
