**Solution.**
In Section 3.1.1.6 of (Yang 2014a), it is clearly indicated that the
partition distance between two trees is the number of bipartitions that
are in one but not the other. Because none of the 3 bipartitions in the
left tree is included in the right tree, and the same holds for the
right tree, the partition distance equals $3 + 3 = 6$.

You can verify this by the following R code. Note that the package ape
needs to be installed.
```R
library(ape)
tree1 <- read.tree(text = "(((c,horse),r), human,(l,b));")
tree2 <- read.tree(text = "(((r,horse),human), b,(l,c));")
dist.topo(tree1,tree2)
```
