**Solution.**

a\) Correct. It is important to note that when we say that some taxa are
more closely related it means that they a more recent common ancestor
than other taxa \[see Section 3.1.1.8 of (Yang 2014a)\]. Because species
d and e share the most recent common ancestor, they are more closely
related to each other than to any others in the tree.

b\) Correct. The sequence similarity may be measured by genetic
distance. In view of the tree, this is calculated as the length of
branches connecting any two tips. According to the Newick-formatted tree
given in the problem, the distance between sequence b and sequence d is
0.01+0.005+0.01+0.015=0.04 which indeed is the smallest.

c\) Incorrect. Because taxa b and e form a monophyly, b is more closely
related to e than to any others in the tree.

d\) Incorrect. Taxa d and f share a more recent common ancestor than
with taxon c.
