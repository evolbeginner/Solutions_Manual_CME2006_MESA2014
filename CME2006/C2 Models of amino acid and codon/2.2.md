**Solution.**

The following assumes $\kappa = 1$. The three codon positions can each
change to three other nucleotides, so the codon TAT which codes for Tyr,
has nine immediate neighbors, namely TAC (Tyr), TAA (\*), TAG (\*), TTT
(Phe), TCT (Ser), TGT (Cys), CAT (His), AAT (Asn), GAT (Asp). Among
these nine, TAA and TAG are stop codon, TAC codes for the same amino
acid as the original one TAT, while the remaining six code for amino
acids different from TAT. Hence, the number of synonymous sites is equal
to $3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$ and that of nonsynonymous sites
is equal to $3 \times \frac{6}{9} = 2$ for the codon TAT.
